# Sean K Smith

Hey! I'm Sean. I really enjoy fiddling around with different little coding projects and learning about the *craft* of programming. I'm currently reading through [Building Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-event-driven-microservices/9781492057888/) by Adam Bellemare, and working on a side-project creating a reference microservice architecture to both help me learn and teach event-driven microservice design.

I also maintain a blog at http://seanksmith.me.
