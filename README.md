# Sean K Smith

Hey! I'm Sean. I really enjoy fiddling around with different little coding projects and learning about the *craft* of programming. I'm currently reading through Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans while I work on a little side project using what I've learned to recreate the game Sidereal Confluence in digital form. Professionally I'm focusing on learning best practices for distributed systems.

Technically I'm most comfortable working in the back-end using either Java (for work) or Go (for personal). When I am writing frontends though I really enjoy using React.

I also maintain a blog at https://seanksmith.me.
